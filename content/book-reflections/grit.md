[Grit: The Power of Passion and Perserverance](https://www.amazon.com/Grit-Passion-Perseverance-Angela-Duckworth/dp/1501111108)

Do you need go that extra mile on a run, add those 5lbs to the barbell, or stay that extra hour at work to acheive what you have your heart set on? Maybe...but there seems to be more to it also. Doing what's hard and challenging is necessary but if you're already on the verge of cardiac collapse, your muscles are no longer responding, or your brain is fried that extra effort won't help you. Obviously, for most of us so we back off a little. Then we find that sweet spot and improve for a bit. Then we all do this again and again until we're all Usain Bolt. But we aren't. Why?


"Why does grit work"? Simply, with grit you put in more *deliberate* effort over time which compounds as the product of effort (i.e. skill) is again used over time.

> [deliberate] effort x time = skill
> skill x time = excellence

Said another way: *deliberate* effort x time x time = excellence = achievement. And that extra time is grit. Do something very well and stick to it. Done. You can go...but don't since **what's most interesting is what's around grit**. The "something" of "do something over a long period of time". The "deliberate" part of "deliberate effort". The "stop doing other things" hidden away behind all the time you put into that ONE thing

Stopping may make sense and sometimes stopping is [the best course of action](https://www.amazon.com/Dip-Little-Book-Teaches-Stick/dp/1591841666). We need time to acheive and so we have to give something up, so counter-intuitively stopping may be the grittiest thing. 

But let's assume it's not, and you need to put in effective effort. [That's a whole topic on it's own](https://www.amazon.com/Practice-Perfect-Rules-Getting-Better-ebook/dp/B007ZQ34V4), but loosely summarized: focus a lot on specifics. Vague and banal but [like many things vague and banal it's incredibly useful](https://youtu.be/OsAd4HGJS4o).

But this is about grit. You don't quit and your purposeful towards...what? Tennis? What's all this effort towards? What's the excellence towards? It needs to be something big so it can last over that long time it takes to get really really good. Answering that "it" can be really hard especially when you have multiple options. It reminds of me of an essay prompt from 8th grade: "what do you want your vocation to be"? Vocation -- not just a job; a calling. How the fuck was I supposed to know that in 8th grade? I wasn't. So coming back to you; what are you using grit to go towards? 

**You don't have to know**. In fact, some of the best goals to work towards are developed after the gritty part has started. For example, a famous artist was asked why he was an artist and he answered "I like the smell of paint." So he painted, got better, painted, got better, and maybe the goal morphed over time. Grit and these huge acheivments often start on small weak interests that grow into life encompassing goals: enjoying writing on a blackboard leads to wanting to teach children, liking the colors and look of a code editor leads to wanting to find the least complex solution in a sea of complexity, etc.
