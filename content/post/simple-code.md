Milana and Patrick were sitting at a group table in the library trying to wrap their heads around how to use for-loops to print out a grid for a CS 101 game they were assigned. Helping them through it, it was obvious that after years of coding the simple act of thinking through the basic logic becomes second nature. At the same time I was trying to wrap my head around a "small" operating system, roughly 500,000 lines of code. It was obvious that even after years of coding trying to understand hugely complex systems -- not coding -- was the basis of software engineering. Many have puzzled over how to tame those hugely complex systems into something that comes as second nature as those basic logic issue Milana and Patrick were struggling with. One of the most effective ways I've seen hugely complex systems tamed is through dead simple code. Code Milana and Patrick could understand.



## Arguments

- Simple code leads to easier mental abstractions because more resources committed to why and where this code fits in instead of "what the fuck is this ammalogomation of filter, map, reduce, join, bullshit, clever fuckery" line of code some pretenious developer wrote.

- Simple code lets you build more mental abstrcations. Mental abstractions allow you to work holistically to achieve the goals of the system without messing up other stuff

- Simple code lets you focus on the architecture and flow because it's easier to read
"As code bases expand its easy to keep adding and adding. Everyone who works with a signifcant piece of software knows their in for a good amount of code reading. Many platitudes are said about it: 90% of the time working with code is reading it, and only 10% is writin it. Writing dead simple code makes that effort easier."

- Simple code makes it more obvious where to add something 
- Related, simple code makes it obvious where the fix needs to go if there is a bug. 
For example, set properties of an object on each line. One of the properties you need missing? Add a line setting that property!
