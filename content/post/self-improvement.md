* most likely way to improve through self relection
    * can improve by luck
    * too much is bad
        * obsessive: we have only so much energy and focusing on improving self takes away from time spending truly expanding
        * narcissitic: there is a point where self-improvement is narcissistic
        * self-improvment can be overly critical

* tips
    * experiment
        * time-box it
        * change one thing
        * decide, then don't think
        
* aside (~maybe, sort of waivering on this section)
    * self-improvement books and videos are closer to pornography than instructional (yes, this is the closest I will every get to making porn)
        * you're not the one actually doing the improvement; you're just watching
        * they are fun
        * you might still learn something but doesn't matter if you don't apply

Goal: 
* tips on how to find balance
* 5 min read
