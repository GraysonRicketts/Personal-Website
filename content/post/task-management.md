Todo lists are great for getting that little dopamine hit when you can check off that box and complete that task that's been on your mind. They give a sense of completion and progress. A sort of "I have my shit together" moment. They can also lead to fatigue: an unending list, reminders of things left undone, a constant pressure to do more, more, MORE! But it doesn't need to be that way. Below is how I stick to the "I get shit done" feeling rather than the "I have too much to do" feeling.

The most effective way to use a todo list is not to track TODOs -- it's to use it as a parking lot for mentally draining things. Put things on that are hard to remember so you don't have to think about. This includes the one-offs and the repetitive tasks of life. Ultimately though, everything on the list should be temporary. It's there to be completed and not seen (at least for a while).


## What to track
Only put things on you can't remember or have a hard time remembering. For example, send Zach that article or cancel Amazon Prime in a month after the free trial ends. Simple and one-off things should be majority of your todo list. Also, those rare repetative things that are hard to remember. For example, deep cleanining your apartment every six months or renewing your drivers license every six years. Often times there is a temptation to put everything you need to do on your todo list: get groceries, close the windows, brush your teeth. This is not the right way to go. You'll end up being shackled to a list. Rather if you have trouble with those things address your habits rather than trying to write down the steps on how to live, otherwise you'll end up fatigued checking your list.

## How to track
So you have an idea of what to track, but how do actually go about adding to and maintaining that list? First, remember that it's meant to be a parking lot for those random, hard to remember things. Be conservative in adding to it. Then, when you do add to it give it a date and give it an importance.

Giving everything a date emphasizes that it's meant to be done. It gives it a temporality and urgency. An importance helps you figure what order to tackle what's in your life. Everything is not urgent -- some things can wait, at least a little bit. 

I break importance into four categories: must do, important, normal, and low. Most important is obviously most important. More than that though it's something that MUST be done; no exceptions. For example, get those reservations for anniversary or get that lump checked out. Next is important which is obviously important and stuff you SHOULD do but the world won't end if you don't. Lastly are normal and low which are used to keep those things that can slide a day or two but would be really good to do.

It's easy to think everything is important so I like to check myself and make sure I'm prirotizing effectively by using this heuristic: 5% should be must do, 30% important, 35% normal, and 30% low.

Now you have a list and everything is prioritzed by due date and importance so it's easy to figure out when you need to do what. DO NOT CHANGE THE IMPORTANCE OR DUE DATE. Think carefully when creating the tasks and again (can't stress it enough) be conservative adding to your todo list. Don't give yourself more to do than you can handle otherwise it will become a graveyard of "things I should have done" rather than an actual tool to help you live more stress free. Do not change the date or urgency. If somethings roll over they roll over, and since you prioritized properly it should be the normal or low urgency things.

## Apps
All of these are good principles but turning them into practice is another thing. Some apps I've tried or recommend are below. They all have due dates and allow you to assign importances.
- Todoist (what I currently use)
- Wunderlist
- Google Tasks
- Outlook tasks
- paper / notebook

## Wrap-up
Create a list of those small things that nag at the back of your mind. Add only what you really need to do and/or what you have trouble remembering. Give them a due date and determine how important it is to get done. Using these techniques to watch those worries over getting stuff done melt away!
